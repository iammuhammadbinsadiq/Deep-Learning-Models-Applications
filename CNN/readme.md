# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Projects

## Overview
Welcome to the "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Projects" repository! This collection offers implementations of CNNs for a variety of image-related tasks, demonstrating the versatility and power of deep learning in computer vision. From emotion recognition to digit classification and real-time object detection, this repository provides well-documented examples to help you understand and apply CNNs in various domains.

## CNN Implementations

### 1. Real-Time Emotion Recognition
- **File:** `real_time_emotion_recognition.ipynb`
- **Description:** This project implements a real-time emotion recognition system using a CNN trained on the FER-2013 dataset. The model classifies facial expressions captured from a webcam into seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral. The project includes model training, real-time detection, and emotion visualization.

### 2. MNIST Digit Classification
- **File:** `cnn_mnist_classification.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook guides you through building a CNN to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It covers all aspects from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, making it a great starting point for beginners.

### 3. Fashion MNIST Image Classification
- **File:** `cnn_fashion_mnist_classification.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook extends CNN usage to more complex image classification tasks with the Fashion MNIST dataset. It provides a comprehensive look at preprocessing, model architecture, and performance evaluation.

### 4. Real-Time Object Detection
- **File:** `object_detection_ssd_mobilenet.py`
- **Description:** This script implements real-time object detection using the SSD MobileNet V2 architecture. It includes loading pre-trained models, processing input images, and visualizing detected objects with bounding boxes.
